# ISN_Projet_Final
Git project made in 12th grade.

## What was the goal ?  
The end goal was just to make a game in Python but we decided to go further and make 8 of them.

## How to run it ?
With python installed, just run the main.py file

You can also launch the server file in the Reseau folder to start saving statistics

## Known bugs

The save file can be corrupted and no statistics will be displayed, the only fix for now is to delete that file and loose all data
